# Very-basic-login-system

## Basic Info
<p> This is a very basic login system which demonstrates the capability of Javascript in the client side (Browser) in performing validations so that load at the server could be reduced. </p>

<p> This particular example includes validations like checking whether the input field is empty or not or like whether the input being provided is a number etc. It also includes event hadling stuffs like binding the onclick event to a function which is fired whenever the button is being clicked.</p>
